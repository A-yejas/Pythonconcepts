The choice between using the `POST` and `PUT` methods in REST API testing depends on the intended
action and how the server should handle the request. Both methods are used to send data to the server,
but they serve different purposes.

### Key Differences:
- **POST**: Used to **create** a new resource. The server determines the resource's URI (ID).
- **PUT**: Used to **update** an existing resource or **create** a resource with a specific URI (ID).

### When to use `POST`:
- You want to **create** a new resource, and you don't know the resource's ID in advance (the server generates it).
- You want to send data without specifying a particular location for it.

### Example: Using `POST` to Create a New Resource
Imagine an API for managing users where you can create a new user.

```bash
POST /users
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john@example.com"
}
```

- The server creates a new user and assigns an ID (e.g., `user_id = 123`).
- The server responds with a new URI for the resource:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 123,
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com"
  }
  ```
- **Key point**: The client doesn't provide the user ID; the server generates it.

### When to use `PUT`:
- You want to **update** an existing resource (you know its ID).
- You want to **create** a resource with a **specific** ID (rare, and only if the server allows this).

### Example: Using `PUT` to Update an Existing Resource
Let's say you want to update the user's information.

```bash
PUT /users/123
{
  "name": "John Smith",
  "email": "johnsmith@example.com"
}
```

- You are updating the user with `ID = 123`.
- The server modifies the existing resource and returns the updated information.

### Why Should You Use `POST` Instead of `PUT` for Creating Resources?

1. **Resource Creation with Unknown ID**:
   - In most cases, when creating resources, you don't know the ID beforehand. `POST` allows the server to generate it.
   In contrast, `PUT` typically requires the client to know or specify the resource ID.

2. **Partial Resource Updates**:
   - `PUT` expects the client to provide the **entire resource** data for the update. If you're only updating a
   part of the resource, `POST` or `PATCH` might be more suitable.

3. **Idempotency**:
   - `PUT` is **idempotent**, meaning calling it multiple times with the same data doesn't change the result.
   However, `POST` is **not idempotent**â€”calling it multiple times may result in creating multiple resources.

### Summary:
- **Use `POST`** when you want to **create** a new resource, and the server generates the ID.
- **Use `PUT`** when you want to **update** an existing resource or create a resource at a specific URI.

For resource creation, `POST` is the correct choice as it allows the server to handle ID assignment,
and it avoids the confusion that may arise from using `PUT` for creation.
