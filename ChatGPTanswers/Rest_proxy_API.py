# How to handle the proxy in Rest API python
'''
To handle proxies in Python when making REST API calls, you can pass the proxy information to the `requests` library,
which is commonly used for API testing. Here's how to do it:

1. **Define Proxies:**
   You can define the proxy servers for HTTP and HTTPS.

2. **Pass Proxies to Requests:**
   Use the `proxies` parameter in your `requests.get()` or `requests.post()` call to route the requests through
   the proxy server.

### Example:

```python
import requests

# Define your proxy
proxies = {
    "http": "http://proxyserver:port",
    "https": "https://proxyserver:port"
}

# Make the GET request through the proxy
response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resource", proxies=proxies)

# Check the response
print(response.status_code)
print(response.text)
```

### Proxy with Authentication:
If your proxy requires authentication, you can pass the username and password in the proxy URL.

```python
proxies = {
    "http": "http://username:password@proxyserver:port",
    "https": "https://username:password@proxyserver:port"
}

response = requests.get("https://api.example.com/resource", proxies=proxies)
print(response.status_code)
```

### Bypassing the Proxy:
If you want to bypass proxies for certain URLs or internal addresses, you can use the `no_proxy` environment variable:

```python
import os

os.environ['NO_PROXY'] = 'localhost,127.0.0.1'

response = requests.get("http://localhost/resource", proxies=proxies)
```

This allows you to handle different API requests based on whether or not they need to go through a proxy.
