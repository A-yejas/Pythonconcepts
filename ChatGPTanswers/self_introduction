My Data

Hi I’m Yejas ,working at Edge Networks as Sr QA Engg.
I hold about 5 Yrs and 3 Months of experience in Python automation development and Manua testing .
I have good hands on experience in Front end testing using Python with selenium
and for the backend testing , worked on Python with request module.
And Having good hands on experience in source code management tool like GitHub and for bugs tracking , we are using the Jira and Test rail tools.
In the current Organization , I worked on project called Path Finder.
This project is about the Internal jobs web application where user can be able to view the jobs posted on this portal and can be able to apply.

here my roles and responsibilities are
 To Perform the sanity and regression test on top of the build releases.
 Triggering the Jenkins build for the automation scripts in stagging Env on daily basis , Triaging and fixing the bugs on Jenkins failures.
Developing the automation test scripts for the new feature developments for frontend  and Backend using python , selenium and Request and also optimizing the pytest framework
Writing and executing manual testcases for the non-automated test scenario’s
creating and assign Bugs on developers with respective to the feature failures
creating stories for the current sprint on top of jira
Following agile methodology and part of sprint ceremonies like sprint planning, sprint retro , sprint review meeting and sprint grooming and daily scrum calls.

On this Project have  creating the employes   the application

Here's an improved and clearer version of your project description:

**Project: Path Finder**

Path Finder is an internal job portal web application designed to allow employees to view and apply for job postings within the organization. The application offers several key features:

1. **User Access Management**:
   - Users are created and granted portal access based on specific criteria such as their country, bandwidth, and additional verification fields like `dfr_flag`. Access is restricted accordingly.

2. **Job Application and Interest Expression**:
   - Users can apply for jobs directly through the portal.
   - If a user’s skills and experience match a job but their job level (band) does not, they can express interest in the job through a designated "Interest" button.
   - Jobs with a duration of 24 months or more are highlighted based on the project duration condition.

3. **Automated Processes**:
   - Upon applying for a job, users receive a success notification, and the job moves to the "Applied Jobs" section.
   - An email is sent to both the respective job manager and the employee regarding the application.
   - Applied jobs are removed from the main job listings and moved to the "Applied Jobs" tab.
   - These jobs are also transferred to another application called "IWO," which managers use to take further action on the applications.

4. **Application Limits**:
   - Users are restricted from applying for more than three jobs if they have not received any status updates on previous applications.
   - This restriction is lifted only when one of their applications is rejected, allowing them to apply for more jobs.

The test scripts for these features were developed and executed using Selenium with Python, ensuring the application functions as intended.

This version is more polished and easier to understand. Let me know if you need any further adjustments!
-----------------------------------------UDEMY ROLEs & RESPONSIBILITIES
Here’s a more detailed and simplified version of your roles and responsibilities:

### **Roles and Responsibilities on Path Finder Project**

1. **Sanity and Regression Testing**:
   - I performed sanity checks to ensure the basic functionalities of the application were working after each new build.
   - I conducted regression testing to verify that new code changes did not negatively impact existing features.

2. **Jenkins Build Management**:
   - I was responsible for triggering the Jenkins build for automation scripts in the staging environment on a daily basis.
   - I monitored the build results, identified any failures, and worked on fixing bugs that caused these failures.

3. **Automation Test Development**:
   - I developed automated test scripts for both frontend and backend features using Python, Selenium, and the Requests library.
   - I optimized the pytest framework to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our test scripts.

4. **Manual Testing**:
   - I wrote and executed manual test cases for scenarios that were not automated, ensuring comprehensive testing coverage.

5. **Bug Management**:
   - I identified and reported bugs, assigning them to the appropriate developers based on the feature that was failing.

6. **Sprint and Story Management**:
   - I created user stories in Jira for the current sprint, detailing tasks and features that needed to be developed or tested.

7. **Agile Methodology**:
   - I followed the agile methodology and actively participated in all sprint ceremonies, including:
     - **Sprint Planning**: Planning the tasks for the upcoming sprint.
     - **Sprint Retrospective**: Reflecting on the past sprint to identify areas of improvement.
     - **Sprint Review**: Reviewing the completed work and getting feedback.
     - **Sprint Grooming**: Refining the backlog by prioritizing tasks.
     - **Daily Scrum Calls**: Attending daily meetings to discuss progress and blockers.

----------OWNED WRITTEN___________------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I worked on project called Path Finder.
This project is about the Internal jobs web application where user can be able to view the jobs posted on this portal
and can be able to apply.
And have creating the users and giving portal access the based on his country and bandwiidth
along with certain fields we have to verify like (dfr_flag e.t.c.,) before giving the access.
By using this application user can able to apply the jobs and also his express the interests where user match the
skills and experience but band is not matching in that cases we showing the interest button like this we have multiple
features on this project and also based project duration condition also we showing the jobs the duration should be
more than or equal to 24 months like that we have features these type of all features we develop the scripts and executed. using selenium   with python.
Once user apply the jobs he got the successful applied toast message and jobs be moved to applied jobs section and sending
the email to respective job manager and employee regarding specific  user specific job is applied and also
we have one more tool integrated with this application like applied jobs should be removes all jobs section and be moved to aapplied jobs tab and
should be trasnfer to iwo application this managers used application. By using this iwo application manager taking the there actions on applied jobs.
and also here we stoping the employee if he applied more than 3 jobs but not get any status for those ,
againwe are allowing only when his any application got rejected like this of sacenerios has developed the test scripts.
correct the spellings and eloborate with simple english
