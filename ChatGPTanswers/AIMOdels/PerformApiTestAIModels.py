#How do we perform api testing on AI modals
'''
API testing on AI models involves testing the interfaces that expose the model’s functionality to ensure the API works
as expected, returns correct outputs, and handles errors properly. The goal is to test both the behavior of the API and
the responses generated by the AI model.

### Steps to Perform API Testing on AI Models

1. **Understand the Model and API**:
   - Identify the endpoints exposed by the AI model (e.g., `/predict`, `/classify`, `/generate`).
   - Understand the input format (e.g., JSON, text, image) and output format (e.g., prediction, confidence score).
   - Know the expected behavior of the model for various types of input.

2. **Set Up the Testing Environment**:
   - Prepare test data: Collect various inputs such as valid, invalid, boundary cases, and edge cases.
   - Use a testing framework like **pytest**, **Postman**, or automated tools like **Selenium** (for API calls) or
   **Request** (Python library) to interact with the API.

3. **Write Test Cases**:
   Develop test cases to cover different scenarios, including:

   - **Positive Test Cases**:
     - Provide valid input to the model and check if the API returns the correct output.
     - For example, if testing an image classification model, send a valid image and verify if it returns the correct
     label and confidence score.

   - **Negative Test Cases**:
     - Provide invalid or malformed input (e.g., wrong data type, missing fields).
     - Ensure that the API handles errors gracefully by returning appropriate status codes
     (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 422 Unprocessable Entity) and meaningful error messages.

   - **Boundary Testing**:
     - Test the limits of the input data, such as extremely long text or very large images.
     - Ensure that the API handles these cases properly without crashing.

   - **Performance Testing**:
     - Test the response time of the API under different loads (e.g., multiple requests, large datasets).
     - For AI models, especially large ones, performance can vary significantly based on input size and model complexity.

   - **Model-Specific Testing**:
     - Test the accuracy of the model on different datasets. If it’s a machine learning model, check if it behaves correctly
     across a variety of input data.
     - For example, test how well a language model generates or classifies text when given inputs from different contexts or domains.

### Example of API Test on an AI Model

Let’s assume you are testing a **text generation API** that generates text based on a given input prompt.

- **API Endpoint**: `POST /generate`
- **Input**: JSON with a text prompt.
  ```json
  {
    "prompt": "Once upon a time"
  }
  ```
- **Output**: Generated text and possibly a confidence score or some metadata.
  ```json
  {
    "generated_text": "Once upon a time, in a faraway land...",
    "metadata": {
      "length": 42,
      "confidence": 0.98
    }
  }
  ```

### Writing Test Cases

#### 1. **Positive Test Case**
- **Test**: Send a valid text prompt and verify that the API generates coherent text.
- **Expected Output**: A generated text response, status code `200 OK`.

```python
import requests

def test_text_generation_valid_input():
    url = "http://api.example.com/generate"
    data = {"prompt": "Once upon a time"}
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)

    assert response.status_code == 200
    response_data = response.json()
    assert "generated_text" in response_data
    assert len(response_data["generated_text"]) > 0
```

#### 2. **Negative Test Case**
- **Test**: Send an empty prompt and check if the API returns an error.
- **Expected Output**: Status code `400 Bad Request` or `422 Unprocessable Entity`.

```python
def test_text_generation_empty_input():
    url = "http://api.example.com/generate"
    data = {"prompt": ""}
    response = requests.post(url, json=data)

    assert response.status_code == 400
```

#### 3. **Performance Testing**
- **Test**: Measure the response time when sending multiple requests simultaneously.
- **Expected Output**: Ensure that response times remain acceptable under load.

```python
import time

def test_text_generation_performance():
    url = "http://api.example.com/generate"
    data = {"prompt": "Performance testing prompt"}

    start_time = time.time()
    for _ in range(10):  # Simulate 10 requests
        response = requests.post(url, json=data)
        assert response.status_code == 200

    end_time = time.time()
    assert (end_time - start_time) < 5  # Ensure all responses were within 5 seconds
```

#### 4. **Boundary Testing**
- **Test**: Send a very long prompt and ensure the API processes it correctly.
- **Expected Output**: Status code `200 OK`, and valid generated text.

```python
def test_text_generation_long_input():
    url = "http://api.example.com/generate"
    long_prompt = "A" * 10000  # A very long input prompt
    response = requests.post(url, json={"prompt": long_prompt})

    assert response.status_code == 200
    assert "generated_text" in response.json()
```

### Special Considerations for AI Model Testing

- **Accuracy and Model Validation**:
  AI models are probabilistic, meaning their responses can vary for the same input. When testing, you need to define
  criteria to evaluate the output's correctness (e.g., using a threshold for accuracy).

- **Bias and Fairness**:
  Test for biases in model predictions. For example, if testing a sentiment analysis API, provide diverse input texts
  and check whether the model handles them fairly without biased predictions.

- **Data Drift**:
  If the AI model relies on a training dataset, periodically test to ensure the model still performs well as
  real-world data evolves.

### Conclusion:
API testing on AI models includes validating the endpoints, inputs, outputs, and performance.
You need to design test cases that cover both normal and edge scenarios, while also considering the inherent
variability of AI model responses. The testing process ensures that the API is robust and that the AI model behaves
correctly under various conditions.
