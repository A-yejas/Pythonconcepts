'''
No, you cannot create an instance of an abstract class in Python. An abstract class is meant to be a blueprint
for other classes. It cannot be instantiated on its own because it may contain one or more abstract methods,
which are methods that are declared but contain no implementation.

In Python, you can define an abstract class by importing the ABC
(Abstract Base Class) module from the abc library, and then using the @abstractmethod decorator to define
abstract methods. If you try to instantiate an abstract class directly, Python will raise a TypeError.

from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class AbstractClass(ABC):

    @abstractmethod
    def some_method(self):
        pass

# Trying to create an instance of AbstractClass will raise an error
instance = AbstractClass()  # This will raise TypeError
