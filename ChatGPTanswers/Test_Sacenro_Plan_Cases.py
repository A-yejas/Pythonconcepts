Here’s a detailed explanation of **Test Scenario**, **Test Case**, **Test Plan**, and the **Bug Life Cycle** in
software testing.

---

### 1. **Test Scenario**

A **Test Scenario** is a high-level description of what to test and how the system behaves under certain conditions.
It defines **what part of the application** will be tested and **how** it will be tested.
Test scenarios are generally broader in scope than test cases.

#### Key Points:
- **Purpose**: To validate the functionality of a specific feature or functionality of an application.
- **Level**: High-level, end-to-end functionality.
- **Example**:
   - Scenario 1: Test the user login functionality for valid and invalid credentials.
   - Scenario 2: Test the functionality of adding a product to the shopping cart.

### 2. **Test Case**

A **Test Case** is a more detailed document that describes the steps, inputs, and expected outcomes
to verify a particular feature or functionality of the system. Test cases are derived from test scenarios.

#### Key Points:
- **Purpose**: To check whether the system works as expected based on given input and conditions.
- **Components**:
  - Test case ID
  - Test scenario reference
  - Preconditions
  - Test steps
  - Expected result
  - Actual result (during execution)
  - Pass/Fail status
- **Example**:
   - **Test Scenario**: Test the user login functionality.
   - **Test Case**:
      - Test case ID: TC_001
      - Precondition: The user must be on the login page.
      - Test Steps:
         1. Enter valid email.
         2. Enter valid password.
         3. Click the "Login" button.
      - Expected Result: The user is successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard.

### 3. **Test Plan**

A **Test Plan** is a document that outlines the entire testing process, including objectives,
scope, approach, resources, schedule, test criteria, and deliverables. It serves as a blueprint for the testing team,
ensuring that testing activities are well-organized and carried out efficiently.

#### Key Components:
- **Test Objectives**: What the testing aims to achieve.
- **Test Scope**: What features will be tested and what won't.
- **Test Approach**: The testing strategy and methodologies (e.g., manual, automated).
- **Resources**: Team members responsible for testing.
- **Schedule**: Timeline for the testing activities.
- **Entry and Exit Criteria**: Conditions that must be met to start and end testing.
- **Deliverables**: Test cases, defect reports, etc.

#### Example:
- **Test Plan** for an E-commerce Website:
   - Objective: Ensure that all critical features like user login, product search, and checkout work correctly.
   - Scope: Frontend, backend, and API testing.
   - Resources: 2 QA engineers, 1 automation engineer.
   - Schedule: Testing will begin on Sept 1 and conclude on Sept 15.

### 4. **Bug Life Cycle (Defect Life Cycle)**

The **Bug Life Cycle** refers to the stages a bug or defect goes through from the time it is identified
until it is fixed and closed.

#### Steps in Bug Life Cycle:

1. **New**:
   - When a tester finds a new defect, it is reported and assigned the status "New."

2. **Assigned**:
   - Once reviewed, the bug is assigned to the developer or the relevant team for fixing.

3. **Open**:
   - The developer starts working on the defect, and the status is changed to "Open."

4. **Fixed**:
   - After the developer fixes the bug, it is marked as "Fixed."

5. **Retest**:
   - The tester verifies the fix by re-executing the test case where the bug was identified.
   The status changes to "Retest."

6. **Verified**:
   - If the fix works as expected, the bug is marked as "Verified."

7. **Closed**:
   - If the issue no longer exists, the bug is closed by the testing team.

8. **Reopen**:
   - If the issue persists after the fix, the tester reopens the bug, and the cycle begins again.

#### Possible Additional States:
- **Deferred**: The bug is recognized but is postponed to be fixed in future releases.
- **Rejected**: The developer determines that the bug is not valid or reproducible.
- **Duplicate**: The bug is already reported in another defect.

#### Example of Bug Life Cycle:
- **Scenario**: The "Add to Cart" button doesn't work on the shopping page.
  1. Tester finds the issue → Status: **New**.
  2. Issue is assigned to a developer → Status: **Assigned**.
  3. Developer fixes the bug → Status: **Fixed**.
  4. Tester retests and verifies the fix → Status: **Verified**.
  5. If successful, the bug is closed → Status: **Closed**.

### Summary:

- **Test Scenario**: A high-level description of what needs to be tested (e.g., user login).
- **Test Case**: A detailed document outlining the steps and expected results for a specific scenario
(e.g., enter valid credentials and verify successful login).
- **Test Plan**: A comprehensive document outlining the testing strategy, objectives, scope, resources, and schedule.
- **Bug Life Cycle**: The process a bug goes through from identification to closure (e.g., from "New" to "Closed").

This framework ensures that software testing is structured, organized, and efficient, resulting in higher software
quality and better user experience.
