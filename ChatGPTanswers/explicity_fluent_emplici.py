->>Explicit waits are like pauses in the code that check repeatedly if a certain condition is met before moving on.
For example, if you're waiting for a button to appear on the page, the code will keep checking until the button shows up.
If the button doesn't appear within a set time (say, 10 seconds), the code will stop and throw an error.

->>The good thing about explicit waits is that you can define exactly what you're waiting for
(e.g., a button to appear, a message to be visible, etc.). Selenium’s Wait class makes it easier by
automatically waiting for the element to be present without you having to add extra checks.

#implicity waits means explain in simple language
'''
Implicit waits in Selenium are like telling the browser to "wait a little" before giving up on finding an element. 
When you set an implicit wait, Selenium will keep trying to find an element for a certain amount of time before it throws an error if the element isn't found.

How it works:-
->>You set an implicit wait, say 10 seconds.
->>When Selenium tries to find an element on the page, if the element isn't immediately available, 
it will keep checking for up to 10 seconds before throwing an error.
->>As soon as the element is found, the code continues without waiting any longer.
Example in simple terms:-
Think of it like standing at a bus stop. You’re waiting for the bus (element). 
You’ll wait up to 10 minutes (10 seconds in Selenium’s case), but if the bus arrives sooner, 
you leave immediately (the code continues). If the bus doesn’t arrive in 10 minutes, you give up and go home 
(an error is raised.

Example:-
from selenium import webdriver

driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Set an implicit wait of 10 seconds
driver.implicitly_wait(10)

# Now Selenium will wait up to 10 seconds for elements to appear
driver.get("https://example.com")
element = driver.find_element(By.ID, "some-element-id")

# No more waiting, the code continues
driver.quit()


'''
#what is the return type of explicit wait
'''
In Selenium WebDriver, the return type of an explicit wait is typically a WebElement or the result of a 
condition specified in the `WebDriverWait` class.

### Explicit Wait with `WebDriverWait`:
The `WebDriverWait` class is used to wait for a certain condition to be true before proceeding. 
It’s part of the `selenium.webdriver.support.ui` module and allows you to wait for specific conditions to be met, 
such as the visibility of an element or the presence of an element in the DOM.

### Common Return Types:
1. **WebElement**:
   - When waiting for an element to become visible or clickable, the result of the wait is usually a `WebElement`.
   - Example: Waiting for an element to be clickable.
     ```python
     from selenium import webdriver
     from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
     from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
     from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

     driver = webdriver.Chrome()

     driver.get("https://example.com")

     # Create a WebDriverWait instance
     wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)

     # Wait until the element is clickable
     element = wait.until(EC.element_to_be_clickable((By.ID, "example")))

     # `element` is a WebElement
     element.click()

     driver.quit()
     ```

2. **Boolean or Other Return Types**:
   - For other conditions, such as waiting for a specific condition to be true (e.g., the presence of a certain text), 
   the return type might be a boolean or another type based on the condition.
   - Example: Waiting for a condition to be true.
     ```python
     from selenium import webdriver
     from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
     from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
     from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

     driver = webdriver.Chrome()

     driver.get("https://example.com")

     # Create a WebDriverWait instance
     wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)

     # Wait until the title contains "Example Domain"
     result = wait.until(EC.title_contains("Example Domain"))

     # `result` is a boolean
     print(result)  # True if the title contains "Example Domain"

     driver.quit()
     ```

### Summary:
- When using explicit waits to interact with elements (like waiting for an element to be visible or clickable), 
the return type is typically a `WebElement`.
- When waiting for conditions that are not directly related to elements (e.g., waiting for a specific 
title or condition to be true), the return type can vary based on the condition (often boolean).

Explicit waits are useful for handling elements or conditions that might take time to appear or become interactable, 
helping to make your Selenium tests more robust and reliable.

##>>correct syntax to identify webelements using multiple conditions in selenium
'''
To identify WebElements using multiple conditions in Selenium WebDriver, you can use the `By` class along with 
`expected_conditions` (EC) for combining multiple conditions. The most common way to handle multiple conditions is by 
using logical operators like `and`, `or`, and `not` within the `expected_conditions` module.

### Syntax for Identifying WebElements Using Multiple Conditions:

1. **Using `expected_conditions` for Multiple Conditions:**

   You can combine multiple conditions using the `and` operator provided by `expected_conditions` 
   to create complex wait conditions.

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver
   from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
   from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
   from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC

   driver = webdriver.Chrome()
   driver.get("https://example.com")

   # Create a WebDriverWait instance
   wait = WebDriverWait(driver, 10)

   # Wait until both conditions are met
   element = wait.until(
       EC.and_(
           EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "example_id")),
           EC.visibility_of_element_located((By.CLASS_NAME, "example_class"))
       )
   )

   # Perform actions with the element
   element.click()

   driver.quit()
   ```

2. **Using CSS Selectors for Multiple Conditions:**

   CSS selectors can be used to combine multiple conditions for locating elements. 
   This method is particularly useful when you want to locate elements with multiple attributes or classes.

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver

   driver = webdriver.Chrome()
   driver.get("https://example.com")

   # Find an element with multiple conditions using CSS selectors
   element = driver.find_element(By.CSS_SELECTOR, "div#example_id.example_class")

   # Perform actions with the element
   element.click()

   driver.quit()
   ```

3. **Using XPath for Multiple Conditions:**

   XPath expressions can combine multiple conditions using logical operators such as `and` and `or`.

   ```python
   from selenium import webdriver

   driver = webdriver.Chrome()
   driver.get("https://example.com")

   # Find an element using XPath with multiple conditions
   element = driver.find_element(By.XPATH, "//div[@id='example_id' and contains(@class, 'example_class')]")

   # Perform actions with the element
   element.click()

   driver.quit()
   ```

### Explanation:

- **`EC.and_()`**: Combines multiple conditions, returning `True` only if all conditions are met.
- **CSS Selectors**: Use combined attribute selectors to find elements with multiple attributes.
- **XPath**: Use logical operators in XPath expressions to find elements matching multiple criteria.

Using these methods allows you to identify elements based on complex criteria, making your 
Selenium tests more precise and robust. Let me know if you need more details or examples!

###########flueent wait means in selenium>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
'''
In Selenium, "Fluent Wait" is a type of wait that allows you to define the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition, as well as the frequency with which to check the condition. Fluent Wait also allows you to ignore specific types of exceptions while waiting, such as `NoSuchElementException`.

### Key Features of Fluent Wait:

1. **Maximum Wait Time**: You specify the maximum amount of time to wait for a condition to be met.
2. **Polling Frequency**: You specify how often Selenium should check the condition. For example, it could check every 500 milliseconds.
3. **Ignoring Exceptions**: You can specify which exceptions to ignore while waiting. Typically, you would ignore exceptions like `NoSuchElementException`, which is thrown when an element is not found immediately.

### Why Use Fluent Wait?

- **Flexibility**: Fluent Wait gives you more control compared to other wait mechanisms like `Implicit Wait` or `Explicit Wait`. It’s particularly useful in situations where the element's presence is unpredictable, and you want to wait with a specific polling interval.
- **Exception Handling**: It allows you to gracefully handle situations where elements might take a while to appear or become clickable, without immediately throwing an error.

### Example in Python:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait
from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC
from selenium.common.exceptions import NoSuchElementException, TimeoutException

# Initialize the WebDriver (assuming Chrome)
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Open a web page
driver.get("https://www.example.com")

# Define Fluent Wait
wait = WebDriverWait(driver, timeout=10, poll_frequency=1, ignored_exceptions=[NoSuchElementException])

try:
    # Wait for an element to be present on the page
    element = wait.until(EC.presence_of_element_located((By.ID, "exampleElementId")))
    # Perform actions on the element
    element.click()
except TimeoutException:
    print("Element not found within the given time.")
finally:
    driver.quit()
```

### Explanation:

- **WebDriverWait**: The `WebDriverWait` class is used to define the Fluent Wait. You pass in the driver, 
the timeout period, and optional parameters like `poll_frequency` (how often to check the condition) and
 `ignored_exceptions` (a list of exceptions to ignore while waiting).
- **until**: The `until` method is used to specify the condition you’re waiting for, such as the presence of
 an element located by a specific ID.
- **Polling Frequency**: In this example, the condition is checked every 1 second until the element is 
found or the timeout (10 seconds) is reached.
- **Exception Handling**: If the element is not found within the given time, a `TimeoutException` is raised, 
and you can handle it accordingly.

### Summary:
Fluent Wait is a more advanced and flexible waiting mechanism in Selenium, allowing for custom polling intervals and 
handling of exceptions, which makes it ideal for scenarios where elements load unpredictably.
