# Recursive:- Recursive function is a function that calls itself during its execution.
# def factorial(n):
#     # Base case: if n is 1, return 1
#     if n == 1:
#         return 1
#     else:
#         # Recursive case: n * factorial of (n-1)
#         return n * factorial(n - 1)
#
# # Test the recursive function
# result = factorial(5)
# print(f"Factorial of 5 is: {result}")

we can open a file 2 ways:
open('filepath', 'r'):- using open we can open only one file at a time and we have to closed a file explicitly.
with open('filepath', 'r'):- using open we can with open multiple files at a time and no need
