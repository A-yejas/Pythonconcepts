CAPL:- Communication Access Programming Language
1.“CAPL is a procedural language whereby the execution of program blocks is controlled by events.
These program blocks are known as event procedures.”
2.CAPL is an event-controlled programming language used for stimulating, simulating, testing and diagnostics.
3.It allows programming of network node models (CANoe)
4.It is also possible to use CAPL for problem-oriented analysis of data traffic or programming a gateway to exchange
data between different busses.
------------------------------------
1.Differences between Environmental variable and System variable?
2.Write a code in CAPL to transmit a message continuously with 500 ms periodicity.
3.Define a buffer which stores the response of Read DTC $19 02. Write a CAPL code to show the status of requested DTC.
If DTC is present, show the status i.e., active or passive. If DTC is not present display a message indicating
DTC is not set.

Variables

{

message message_DBC_name var_name = {dlc = 8};

}

on timer t1_500ms

{

var_name.byte(0) = 0x33;

var_name.byte(1) = 0x55;

var_name.byte(2) = 0x44;

output(var_name);

setTimer(t1_500ms,500);

}

on start

{

setTimer(t1_500ms,500);

}

Q:-What is the bit size of a Boolean variable?
Boolean variables are stored as 16-bit (2-byte) numbers, but they can only be True or False.
