1.So the reason why we call this acceptance, because the way we write test cases is are like more user
friendly or business standards.
2.So most of the test cases in robot framework are driven by keywords or behavior driven and data driven.
So you won't see the real raw code in the test.
It's all about plain English language, like login to the browser, click the edit box.
All the plain language will be driven through keywords and you can also use behavioral driven BDD approach.
3.So the test cases in this robot framework will look very user friendly so that it can be used for acceptance
4.So the reason why people choose this is because it has very, very easy syntax and utilizing human readable.
5.There is no other framework in the market as easy as robot.
6.Robot framework is built on Python, but you can also have a libraries where you can write the framework.
7.** test case in the robot framework is nothing but collection of keywords.
8.There are a lot of things are there and Robot mainly supports three locators, which is ID, XPath,CSS.
9.robot framework will generate log file for you automatically.
10. if you are using ID locator, you really need not actually concatenate with this.like(id:name)
You can also simply write ID.
But if it is XPath or CSS, you have to clearly tell xpath CSS in the prefix.
If it is id, you can also tell but you can skip also if you skip by default, robot treats it as an.
11.***So if you have a class name and if you want to build CSS out of it, just put one dot and then write
12.And all coding related things you can find from this inbuilt keyword.
